## Introduction

Background:  
Music players are a common multimedia application. This project demonstrates how to build one using Object-Oriented Programming in C++, integrating multimedia control, file handling, and GUI design.

Problem Statement:  
Despite understanding OOP theory, many students struggle to apply it in practical, multimedia-based projects. This music player bridges that gap by applying OOP principles in a real-world application with audio handling and an interactive GUI.

### Objectives

- Provide playback controls: play, pause, stop, resume, next, previous.
- Allow playlist and favorite song management.
- Design a graphical user interface using **SFML**.
- Demonstrate core OOP concepts: encapsulation, modularity, class design, and file handling.

## Scope of the Project

### Inclusions

- Play, pause, stop, and resume songs
- Manage playlists and favorites
- Navigate songs (next/previous)
- File handling using fstream
- GUI built with **SFML**
- Backend functionality via OOP classes

### Exclusions

- Advanced audio formats or streaming
- Cross-platform compatibility (limited to Windows)

## Project Description

Overview:  
The player is centered on an Action class that handles all music operations. Songs are stored as file paths, managed using vectors. The project emphasizes OOP best practices, including class abstraction, encapsulation, and modular design. A simple and interactive GUI will be developed using **SFML**.

### Technical Requirements

- **Language:** C++
- **Audio Library:** Windows .
- **GUI Library:** **SFML**
- **Tools:** Visual Studio / VS Code
- **File Handling:** fstream

### Project Phases

1. Design class structure and file management
2. Implement audio playback functionality
3. Add playlist and favorite song features
4. Develop GUI using SFML
5. Integrate navigation and interaction
6. Testing and final adjustments

## Methodology

### Approach

- Modular, object-oriented development
- Iterative build process with milestone tracking
- Individual team responsibilities to ensure progress

### Team Responsibilities

- **Yash Raj** – SFML implementation
- **Shahnawaz Khuwaja** – GUI and navigation features
- **Asad Ahmed** – Core logic, playback features, final testing , SFML implementation
- **Lucky** – Playlist logic, data storage, and testing

## Expected Outcomes

### Deliverables

- Fully functional C++ music player with GUI
- Source code and all assets
- Documentation of design, implementation, and OOP principles used

Relevance:  
This project reinforces essential skills in OOP, multimedia programming, GUI development, and collaborative software engineering—key areas in the field of Computer Science.

## Resources Needed

### Software

- Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code
- Windows OS
- **SFML** Library

### Other Resources

- SFML and Windows Multimedia API documentation
- C++ tutorials and multimedia programming guides
- Feedback from Teaching Assistant
